                    I was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas (proud Texan!). Now living in the beautiful Boulder, CO!
                    <br> <br>
                    Graduated from the University of Texas at San Antonio with my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics. 
                    Currently, I am a Ph.D. student in the Superhuman Computing Lab at the University
                    of Colorado Boulder, under the advisment of Shaun Kane, focusing on research in Human Computer Interaction with a specialization in accessibility and assistive technologies. 
                    The majority of my research focuses on fairness, equality, and independence in the area of accessibility. 
                    <!--Specficially, I want to dive into how we can empower children to be indepedent and provide them with tools to be successful regardless of circumstances.-->
                    <br> <br>
                    My current projects look at making board games accessible and ways we can make these games fun and fair for everyone,
                    where all players can be indepedent and have full autonomy. Head over to the Projects page to learn more!

                    Many board games present their information visually, such as text on the cards and the location of the game pieces.
                    This causes accessibility challeneges for people with visual impairments. 
                    Game Changer is a tool to be utilized by people with visual impairments to receive information about the state of a board game. 
                    Players are able to get the information on cards read and the location of their game pieces as well as their opponent's.

                    People with visual impairments label cards with Braille to make them accessible. However, this process can be ardous. 
                    LabelGen provides a quicker and more affordable option to do-it-yourself accessibility methods
                    or purchasing accessibility kits from sites like 64oz Games and MaxiAids. 
                    LabelGen uses a template of the important regions of the card established through an interdependent relationship between blind and sighted players. 
                    It uses these templates when it scans the card to extract the information, to translate it into Braille, and print out a Braille label. 
                    If the card contains too much text, 
                    then a QR code is printed to be scanned by the mobile application that will relay all the textual information in an audio format.

                    Half of children from low income communities start first grade up to two years behind their peers [1]. 1 in 4 children in America
                    grow up without learning how to read [2]. These statistics motivate this project, Rainie the Reading Robot. Rainie is a aid for children
                    during storytime, where the teddy bear robot will read aloud any words that the child is unfamiliar with. Over time, we hope that this 
                    relationship will result in an improvement in the child's reading level. Rainie is a stand-in for parents who do not have the time 
                    or grasp of the langauge to have a storytime with their children. This teddy bear project will empower children to take control of their
                    reading development and provide them with the tool to do so.

        <h1>Design Challenge 2: 3D Printed Interlocking Shapes</h1>
        <h3>With an FDM printer, design and fabricate (print) a 3D object that fulfills the following constraints:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Object should be a single STL file.</li>
            <li>Object’s bounding box should be no larger than 2 inches on all sides.</li>
            <li><dt>Object should consist of at least 2 interlocking parts, which:</dt></li><dt>
            <dd>Are not fused to each other / free moving.</dd>
            <dd>Cannot separate from each other.</dd>
        </ol>
            
        
        <h2>Attempt One: Interlocking Cube</h2>
        <p>
                I did not account for the space I would need to cut the support off, 
                I ended up only having about 1mm of clearance so that wasn't going to work. 
                I needed to create enough space between the objects that I could snip off the support.
        </p>

        <h2>Attempt Two: Interlocking Pentagons</h2>
        <p>
                I decided to create interlocking pentagons and angle them so a part of the shape was on the ground, 
                with the thought process that is a small piece of the shape is touching the ground then it wouldn’t need support.
                The shapes ended up printing midair, which does not work.

        <h2>Attempt Three: Interlocking Pentagons and Triangles</h2>
        <p>
                I took the knowledge from my two failures and created enough clearance for the support 
                and made sure that one entire face of the shape was on the ground.

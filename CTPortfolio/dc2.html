        <h1>Attempt One: Interlocking Cube</h1>
        <p>
                I did not account for the space I would need to cut the support off, 
                I ended up only having about 1mm of clearance so that wasn't going to work. 
                I needed to create enough space between the objects that I could snip off the support.

        <h1>Attempt Two: Interlocking Pentagons</h1>
        <p>
                I decided to create interlocking pentagons and angle them so a part of the shape was on the ground, 
                with the thought process that is a small piece of the shape is touching the ground then it wouldnâ€™t need support.
                The shapes ended up printing midair, which does not work.

        <h1>Attempt Three: Interlocking Pentagons and Triangles</h1>
        <p>
                I took the knowledge from my two failures and created enough clearance for the support 
                and made sure that one entire face of the shape was on the ground.
